js-module-example
=================

This is just a JS example app using npm, common-js and browserify. Nothing fancy.

## Instalation

- Clone the git repository and go to the folder
- `npm install to install all dependencies`
- After the instalation run `./node_modules/.bin/browserify app.js -o app.bundle.js` to generate the app bundle. This file will be used on index.html
- Open index.html and check out the browser console log

### About

This code was found on [Ampersand.js documentation](http://ampersandjs.com/learn/npm-browserify-and-modules). I thought it'll be nice to have to just have it here.
